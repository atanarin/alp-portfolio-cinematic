Perfect — I’ll make a **comprehensive README template** for your **Fantasy Football Web App** that you can fill in as development completes.
This version assumes your stack is **React (Vite) frontend + Flask backend + MySQL (or PostgreSQL) + AWS deployment** with optional **Redis or WebSockets/SSE** for live updates.

# 🏈 Fantasy Football Web App

A full-stack fantasy football platform that allows users to create leagues, draft teams, manage rosters, and track live scores in real time. Built with **React + Flask + MySQL**, designed for scalability, and deployable on **AWS** (Beanstalk, RDS, and CloudFront).

---

## 🚀 Features

### User & Authentication

* Secure signup/login with hashed passwords
* Role-based access (admin, player, guest)
* Session persistence across browser reloads

### League Management

* Create and join leagues
* Team creation and roster editing
* Invite other users via email or league code

### Live Data

* Real-time score updates using **SSE/WebSockets**
* Automatic data refresh from external APIs (e.g., player stats)
* Optimized caching with Redis or in-memory store

### Frontend (React + Vite)

* Responsive, modern UI built with Tailwind or MUI
* State management via React Query / Redux
* Dynamic components for league dashboard, drafts, and standings

### Backend (Flask)

* RESTful API endpoints
* JWT or cookie-based authentication
* Data validation with Marshmallow or Pydantic
* ORM using SQLAlchemy

### Database (MySQL or PostgreSQL)

* Normalized schema for users, leagues, teams, players, and matches
* Relationships managed via SQLAlchemy models
* Seed scripts for test data

### Deployment

* Flask app served via **Gunicorn + Nginx**
* Frontend built and hosted on **AWS S3 + CloudFront** or **Vercel**
* Backend deployed via **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**
* **RDS** for database
* Optional CI/CD using **GitHub Actions**

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fantasy-football.git
cd fantasy-football
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Backend (Flask)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://ffuser:ffpass@127.0.0.1:3306/ffdb
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
FLASK_ENV=development
```

Run database migrations:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

Run the server:

```bash
flask run
```

### 3️⃣ Set Up Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 Development Workflow

1. **Backend changes:**
   Use Alembic migrations for schema updates:

   ```bash
   flask db migrate -m "add new table"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

2. **Frontend changes:**
   Use Vite hot-reload and run parallel with Flask:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   flask run
   ```

3. **Testing:**

   ```bash
   pytest
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Linting:**

   ```bash
   black backend/
   eslint src/
   ```

---

## ☁️ Deployment (AWS)

### Backend (Elastic Beanstalk)

1. Install AWS CLI and configure credentials
2. Initialize environment:

   ```bash
   eb init -p python-3.11 fantasy-football
   eb create fantasy-football-env
   ```
3. Deploy:

   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

### Frontend (CloudFront or Vercel)

```bash
npm run build
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Future Work

### Planned Additions

* Player draft simulation with live picks
* Advanced analytics dashboard (Fantasy Points, Projections)
* ML-based player performance predictions
* User notifications & live trade updates

Would you like me to **generate a versioned README (with badges, CI/CD badges, and API docs link)** for GitHub too?
That version looks more professional and automatically updates build status and deployment links.
