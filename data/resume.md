EXPERIENCE  
Lab Researcher                                                       
Fay Lab at the University of Rochester Computational Biology Department                             
August 2024 - February 2025 
Rochester, NY 
● Built Python workflows with PAML and Tranalign to model large-scale data and automate divergence analysis 
● Built benchmarking frameworks applying causal inference and A/B testing methods to optimize accuracy-latency 
tradeoffs, mirroring product experimentation culture 
● Consolidated structural datasets into a unified database, streamlining analysis for cross-team research and enabling 
scalable queries across millions of data points 
● Translated biological stability analyses into scalable statistical frameworks, identifying outliers and ranking system 
performance in ways comparable to product experimentation pipelines 
Product Analytics & ML  Intern                       
June 2024 - October 2024 
Align Technologies                                     
Santa Clara, CA 
● Built scalable SQL + Python pipelines integrating structured/ unstructured datasets (~2000 doctors), reducing 
manual analysis time by ~75% and enabling product/finance stakeholders to track prescribing patterns in real-time 
● Developed NLP + ML pipelines (spaCy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch) for classifying prescribing patterns and 
predicting treatment decisions with SHAP explainability, achieving 91% accuracy across 300k+ records, enabling 
product managers to forecast adoption trends and guiding finance teams in resource allocation 
● Developed reusable ML components and APIs in Python for training, classification, and explainability, 
establishing standardized workflows that enabled reproducible deployment and cross-team experimentation  
Lab Researcher                                                                                   
August 2023 - May 2024 
Thornton Lab at the URMC Neurological Department                            
Rochester, NY  
● Conducted PCR, gel electrophoresis, DNA extraction, and prepared samples for Oxford Nanopore (Guppy), PacBio, 
and Sanger sequencing, ensuring high-quality molecular workflows for downstream genomic analysis and validation 
● Developed automated CI-style genomic analysis pipelines in Bash/nf-core with reproducibility, dataset versioning, 
and modular testing, analogous to production CI workflows 
Computational Biology Teaching Assistant                                                                            
January 2024 - May 2024 
Hajim School of Engineering                                      
Rochester, NY  
● Taught 30+ students Python-based bioinformatics workflows and guided weekly coding biostatistics projects 
PROJECTS 
Fantasy Football Web App         
2025 (MVP completed, expanding features) 
● Developed a full stack application with React, Node.js, and Flask APIs to manage players, rosters and 
projections, integrating dynamic data feeds for interactive team management 
● Built MySQL schemas, migrating to PostgreSQL for scalability; developed REST endpoints for roster updates/stats 
● Implementing user authentication, component-based UI and state management to support real-time tracking 
● Implemented real-time player and score updates using WebSockets and Server-Sent Events, paired with a cache 
write-through (Redis) database strategy to ensure data consistency, reduce latency, and handle concurrent user 
sessions efficiently 
Fraud Detection Database System               
Fall 2024 
● Built a fraud detection database system with schemas for transactions, users, behavior, card data, and ML predictions, 
scaling to millions of rows with built-in role-based access controls, encryption, and audit logs 
● Integrated Kaggle fraud datasets and built ML-driven fraud flagging with probability scores for real-time detection 
● Modeled administrator, data scientist, and auditor workflows to demonstrate scalability and alignment with real-world 
financial fraud detection systems.  
Capture the Flag AI Agent                            
November 2024 
● Developed an intelligent agent for a 2D grid-based Capture the Flag game, using A* search for real-time pathfinding 
and navigation through dynamic environments with obstacles and enemy zones, integrated minimax with alpha-beta 
pruning to simulate and counter opponent strategies in adversarial scenarios, and trained a Naive Bayes classifier to 
predict likely trap zones and ambush patterns based on historical movement data
